# CAP local development workshop

The content of this repository is for use in a reCAP 2025 hands-on workshop:

Title: Stay cool, stay local

Abstract: CAP has myriad features to help developers develop. And that means local first, in a tight feedback loop. In this session you'll learn about those features and tools at your disposal as a CAP developer (predominantly Node.js) and get the chance to try some of them out yourself.

## Exercises

Work through each of the following exercises one at a time, each of which cover one or more topics that are relevant for local development (and are shown in brackets following the exercise titles). When reading through the exercises, actions for you to take, things you have to do yourself, are indicated with the ðŸ‘‰ symbol.

- [00 - setting up and getting to a running server](exercises/00/) ([cds watch])
- [01 - cds watch, SQLite, initial data and sample data](exercises/01/) ([cds watch], [SQLite], [initial data])
- [02 - configuration profiles, more on initial data, and the cds REPL](exercises/02/) ([configuration profiles], [initial data], [cds REPL])
- [03 - mocking auth and required services](exercises/03) ([mock user authentication], [mocking of required services])
- [04 - a first look at local messaging and events](exercises/04) ([local messaging], [file-based messaging])
- [05 - workspaces, monorepos and more on messaging and events](exercises/05) ([workspaces and monorepos], [plugins], [file-based messaging])
- [06 - debugging local and remote servers](exercises/06) ([debugging remote applications])
