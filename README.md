# CAP local development workshop

The content of this repository is for use in a reCAP 2025 hands-on workshop:

Title: Stay cool, stay local

Abstract: CAP has myriad features to help developers develop. And that means local first, in a tight feedback loop. In this session you'll learn about those features and tools at your disposal as a CAP developer (predominantly Node.js) and get the chance to try some of them out yourself.
