# Exercise 03 - mocking auth and required services

There's no avoiding the fact that if you want your CAP apps and services to be useful, they're going to have to make use of authentication mechanisms, and consume other APIs, in the cloud. In local development mode, however, these requirements can get in the way and hinder progress.

Fortunately the "developer centric" nature of CAP's local-first strategy provides various ways to not _ignore_ the reality, but to _suspend_ it until it's really needed. With the "mocking" approach, we can design and declare our domain model and adorn it with annotations relating to authentication, and rely on mocked authentication while still thinking about, defining and testing user role and attribute based access control. We can also have required services mocked for us so we can connect to them from our own.

In this exercise we'll explore both those topics.

## Observe the current state of authentication

You may have already noticed the mocked authentication approach declared in the CAP server's log lines.

ðŸ‘‰ Check this by stopping any currently running CAP server (the `cds watch` process), restarting it with:

```bash
DEBUG=auth cds w --profile classics
```

and observe this output:

```log
[cds] - using auth strategy {
  kind: 'mocked',
  impl: 'node_modules/@sap/cds/lib/srv/middlewares/auth/basic-auth'
}
```

The "mocked" [authentication strategy] uses HTTP Basic Authentication (simple usernames and passwords) combined with [assignment of preconfigured roles to some test users]. It's more or less the same as the "basic" authentication strategy, but with this user and role pre-configuration.

### Try accessing AdminService resources

The `AdminService` (currently made available at `/odata/v4/admin`) has a [@requires] annotation which declares that only users with the `admin` role have access:

```cds
using { sap.capire.bookshop as my } from '../db/schema';
service AdminService @(requires:'admin') {
  entity Books as projection on my.Books;
  entity Authors as projection on my.Authors;
}
```

#### Attempt an unauthenticated request

ðŸ‘‰ Try to access the `Books` resource within that service without supplying any authentication detail:

```bash
curl -i -s localhost:4004/odata/v4/admin/Books
```

This should result in an HTTP 401 response that will look like this (other response headers have been omitted for brevity):

```log
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Users"
```

This will also have been logged by the CAP server due to the `DEBUG=auth` setting:

```log
[basic] - 401 > login required
```

As authorization checks (in play here) are predicated on verified identity claims, [authentication is a prerequisite] here.

#### Attempt a request authenticated as a user without the requisite role

ðŸ‘‰ Try authenticating with the pre-defined user "yves", who has the role "internal-user":

```bash
curl -i -s -u 'yves:' localhost:4004/odata/v4/admin/Books
```

> The colon separates the username and password when supplying this detail via `curl`'s `--user` (or `-u`) option. None of the pre-defined users have passwords.

Underlining the difference between HTTP [401] and HTTP [403] responses, this request should elicit:

```log
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```

with some extra info in the CAP server log output too:

```log
[basic] - authenticated: { user: 'yves', tenant: undefined, features: undefined }
[odata] - GET /odata/v4/admin/Books
[error] - 403 - Error: Forbidden
    at requires_check (/work/scratch/myproj/node_modules/@sap/cds/lib/srv/protocols/http.js:54:32)
    at http_log (/work/scratch/myproj/node_modules/@sap/cds/lib/srv/protocols/http.js:42:59) {
  code: '403',
  reason: "User 'yves' is lacking required roles: [admin]",
  user: User { id: 'yves', roles: { 'internal-user': 1 } },
  required: [ 'admin' ],
  '@Common.numericSeverity': 4
}
```

> Briefly:
>
> Response Code | Meaning | In short
> -|-|-
> 401|The request lacked valid authentication credentials|Can't verify who you are
> 403|The request did contain valid credentials (i.e. was properly authenticated) but the authenticated user does not have the requisite permissions|Your identify is verified but you don't have access

#### Make a request authenticated as a user with the requisite role

ðŸ‘‰ Repeat the same resource request but this time as user "alice", who does have the "admin" role:

```bash
curl -s -u 'alice:' localhost:4004/odata/v4/admin/Books \
  | jq .value[].title
```

Success! Here's what the CAP server shows:

```log
[basic] - authenticated: { user: 'alice', tenant: undefined, features: undefined }
[odata] - GET /odata/v4/admin/Books
```

and here's what's returned:

```log
"Wuthering Heights"
"Jane Eyre"
"The Raven"
"Eleonora"
"Catweazle"
```

### Look at @requires and @restrict annotations with the Ex01Service

In a previous exercise we [added a new service definition]; now we'll add some annotations to that to get a feel for how they work, and how the mocked strategy supports exactly what would be supported in production.

#### Set up restrictions

ðŸ‘‰ Add annotation declarations to the `srv/ex01-service.cds` file so the entire content ends up looking like this:

```cds
using { sap.capire.bookshop as my } from '../db/schema';
@path: '/ex01' service Ex01Service {
  entity Books as projection on my.Books;
}

annotate Ex01Service with @requires: 'authenticated-user';
annotate Ex01Service.Books with @restrict: [
  { grant: 'READ' },
  { grant: 'WRITE', to: 'backoffice' }
]);
```

This sets up:

- a requirement for any request to be authenticated (i.e. made with a verified identity)
- a restriction on the `Books` entity in that any authenticated user can perform read operations, but only users with the "backoffice" role can perform write operations

#### Make an unauthenticated request

ðŸ‘‰ Try to retrieve the details of the book with ID 207 ("Jane Eyre") without providing any authentication details:

```bash
curl -i -s localhost:4004/ex01/Books/207
```

As expected, we don't get very far with this:

```log
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Users"

Unauthorized
```

#### Make authenticated requests with an administrative user

ðŸ‘‰ Try that again, authenticating as the pre-defined administrative user "alice":

```bash
curl -i -s -u 'alice:' localhost:4004/ex01/Books/207
```

The conditions of the (rather general) `READ` grant, combined with the `authenticated-user` requirement, are both fulfilled, meaning success for Alice:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"@odata.context":"$metadata#Books/$entity","createdAt":"2025-06-23T13:26:48.247Z","createdBy":"anonymous","modifiedAt":"2025-06-23T13:26:48.247Z","modifiedBy":"anonymous","ID":207,"title":"Jane Eyre","descr":"..."}
```

But can Alice perform operations with the `WRITE` semantic?

ðŸ‘‰ Try it:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -i -s -u 'alice:' localhost:4004/ex01/Books/207
```

No!

```log
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

{"error":{"message":"Forbidden","code":"403","@Common.numericSeverity":4}}
```

#### Define a new office user

While there are pre-defined users we can make use of in the mocked authentication strategy, we can define our own too, which is especially helpful when we're iterating locally on building out the domain model and including the security considerations with that.

We could put this configuration in `package.json#cds` but for a change, let's use a [project-local .cdsrc.json] file.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a `.cdsrc.json` file in the project root, with this content for Milton, the [stapler guy]:

```json
{
  "requires": {
    "auth": {
      "users": {
        "milton": {
          "password": "dontmovemydesk",
          "roles": [
            "stapler"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once this is saved, the CAP server will restart.

Just for interest, check the effective environment, specifically for the auth details:

```bash
cds env requires.auth
```

This should emit:

```log
{
  restrict_all_services: false,
  kind: 'mocked',
  users: {
    alice: { tenant: 't1', roles: [ 'admin' ] },
    bob: { tenant: 't1', roles: [ 'cds.ExtensionDeveloper' ] },
    carol: { tenant: 't1', roles: [ 'admin', 'cds.ExtensionDeveloper' ] },
    dave: { tenant: 't1', roles: [ 'admin' ], features: [] },
    erin: { tenant: 't2', roles: [ 'admin', 'cds.ExtensionDeveloper' ] },
    fred: { tenant: 't2', features: [ 'isbn' ] },
    me: { tenant: 't1', features: [ '*' ] },
    yves: { roles: [ 'internal-user' ] },
    '*': true,
    milton: { password: 'dontmovemydesk', roles: [ 'stapler' ] }
  },
  tenants: { t1: { features: [ 'isbn' ] }, t2: { features: '*' } }
}
```

Alongside the pre-defined users we can see Milton.

> Adding the `--profile classics` option here is also possible, but the end result is the same in this case.

#### Authenticate a request with the new office user

ðŸ‘‰ Let's try this new user, like this:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -i -s -u 'milton:dontmovemydesk' localhost:4004/ex01/Books/207
```

Not quite!

```log
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden

{"error":{"message":"Forbidden","code":"403","@Common.numericSeverity":4}}
```

Of course, we need to give him the "backoffice" role.

ðŸ‘‰ Do that now by adding it to the `[ ... ]` list of roles in `.cdsrc.json` so that it looks like this:

```json
"roles": [
  "stapler",
  "backoffice"
]
```

Now try again:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -i -s -u 'milton:dontmovemydesk' localhost:4004/ex01/Books/207
```

Success!

```log
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

This just scratches the surface of what's possible; remember that the power of all of the abstracted authentication and authorisation layers (including users) is available to all authentication strategies, even (or "especially") the ones designed for local development. And there's no change when one moves to production, at that level.
